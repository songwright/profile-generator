# Developer Profile Generator

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username. I made this for my Full Stack Boot Camp class at the UCLA Extension School.

The user will be prompted for a favorite color, which will be used as the background color for cards. The user also supplies the GitHub user name. The result is a PDF file that can be used to share information about the GitHub user.
